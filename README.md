# Result
Based on the model performance summary, the Random Forest model demonstrates the best performance with the lowest RMSE (0.7035) and the highest R² score (0.9759). A lower RMSE indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values, and a higher R² suggests a stronger correlation between the predicted and actual outcomes.
Comparatively, while the Decision Tree model also performs well with an RMSE of 0.9209 and R² of 0.9586, the Random Forest model further refines prediction accuracy by reducing variance and improving generalization.
Other models, such as FNN, LSTM, and CNN, exhibit relatively higher RMSE values and lower R² scores, indicating suboptimal performance for this task.
Thus, the Random Forest model is selected as the best model for this problem.
